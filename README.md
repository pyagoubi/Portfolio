In this project I have used different models to predict the likelihood of default for customers scoring in the top 16%. The project contains Explorative Data Analysis, Feature Engineering training and predicting default probabilities. 

Skills and tools used: **EDA, XGBoost**, **LightGBM**

This project includes different models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. Recommendations were generated based on previous ratings for other products.

Skills and tools used: **EDA, Collaborative Filtering, SVD/ Matrix Factorization**

In this project the SVHN (Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition) dataset was used to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect houring numbers.

Skills and tools used: **CNN, Tensorflow, image recognition**
