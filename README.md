# Data Science Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

## Projects

In this project I have used NLP models to assess the language proficiency of 8th-12th grade English Language Learners.

Tools used: **HuggingFace, DeBERTa**, **BERT**

In this project the SVHN (Street View Housing Number Digit Recognition) dataset was used to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect houring numbers.

Tools used: **CNN, Tensorflow, Image Recognition**
