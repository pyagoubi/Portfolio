# Data Science Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

## Projects

Use langchain agents to talk to your data and receive the answer as a bar chart, line graph or table. You require a valid OpenAI Key.

Main tools:  **Langchain**, **Tkinter**, **OpenAI-API**
