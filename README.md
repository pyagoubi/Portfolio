# Data Science Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and hobby purposes. 

## Projects

I have used a BERT model for sequential recommendation (based on https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06690). 

Tools used:  **BERT**, **BERT4Rec**, **Word2Vec**, **Pytorch Lightning**

**[Word2Vec based recommendation engines](https://github.com/pyagoubi/Word2Vec-based-recommendation-engines)**

In this project I use Word2Vec to create 1) similarity based and 2) session based recommendations based on Word2Vec.

Tools used: **Word2Vec**
